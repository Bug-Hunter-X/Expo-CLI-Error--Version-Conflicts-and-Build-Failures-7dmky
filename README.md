This repository demonstrates a common Expo CLI error stemming from version conflicts between Expo modules and the CLI itself.  The `expoBug.js` file shows example code leading to the error (although the error is in the build process itself, not in runtime code).  The solution in `expoBugSolution.js` provides steps to fix the problem. This is particularly relevant to developers working with older Expo projects or those encountering unexpected build failures during updates.
