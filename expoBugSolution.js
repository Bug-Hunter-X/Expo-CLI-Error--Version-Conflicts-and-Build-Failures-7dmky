The primary solution is to ensure all your Expo packages are up-to-date and compatible.  Use the following command to upgrade the Expo CLI and related packages:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install expo
```

If this doesn't work, you may need to check your `package.json` file and manually update the version numbers of Expo modules. Make sure the versions are compatible with each other and with the installed version of the Expo CLI.  Sometimes, downgrading certain packages can resolve conflicts. Carefully review the version numbers and consult the Expo documentation for compatibility information.

If the problem persists, try cleaning your project's cache using:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

Consider creating a new Expo project from scratch to rule out any local configuration issues. You may also need to check the Expo CLI's release notes for any known compatibility issues.
